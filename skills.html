          <h1>Hello, my name is Vitor</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a Junior Front-End WebDeveloper. I have always had interest in computers and I wish
            to make this my new project of life. Worked as a nurse since 2012 until present, I have
            worked in Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª and UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. This year I decided it was time to change
            my working life direction, I got into an online/live training for a full course of
            Front-End WebDeveloper which took me 7 months to complete. There I have learned from the
            most basic to the most advanced coding in HTML, CSS (SASS included) and Javascript (with
            React framework).
